    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Usually, a program runs on the computer and takes data as its input, and returns data as output.</p>

<p>For example, running a simple program to do addition, the input would be the two addends and the result would be the sum.</p>

<h1>Compiler</h1>

<p>A compiler is a peculiar program, in that the data is another program&rsquo;s source code. A compiler takes another program&rsquo;s source code as its input and returns an executable program as its output. In the case of a language such as Java which runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and not directly on the operating system itself, the output would be a form of bytecode.</p>

<p>In the case of a language such as C++, the compiler usually takes the source code and returns the executable program itself, or object code. In this sense the word code is used to refer to a part of a program, not source code. However, there is still another step that takes place after this.</p>

<h1>Linker</h1>

<p>A program is almost always written on top of some sort of library. This library has some basic functionality such as input/output, the handling of streams, arrays etc. The object code for the program needs to be hooked up to this library code, otherwise it won&rsquo;t work at runtime. This is where the linker comes in. A linked combines the library object code with the object code from the compiled program.</p>
