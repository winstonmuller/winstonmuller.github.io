**On Main Memory**
Discuss how memory is organised (a series of locations, each a set size and identified by an address,  in software identified by a variable name). Discuss how memory can traverse multiple locations. Common data structure sizes. How to find the size of a data type. Strings and their endings. Virtual memory vs Physical memory. How address space works.

Follow up: Discuss the different address types and how they work in assembly.

**cpp inline functions**
Declaring a function inline substitutes the code everywhere the function is called for better perfomance at the cost of greater size.
